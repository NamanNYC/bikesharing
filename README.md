## Conclusion
We can conclude from the analysis' that in order for a Bikeshare idea in Iowa to be successful, the service needs to be in densely populated areas. Typically, the demographic is working since the more popular days of this service being used are the weekdays, more specifically the middle of the week on Thursdays. In addition, there should be incentives offered for subscribers as well as weekend use so that the userbase can increase. Other visualizations to consider creating could be a relationship between safety and gender, and a relationship between Top Starting Locations and Checkout Times.
